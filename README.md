# DGE-PTB
Preterm Birth (PTB), defined as birth before 37 weeks of gestation, leads to adverse outcomes in newborns and can cause death. We explore the transcriptomic landscape associated with PTB through an evolutionary lens. Successful pregnancies require a delicate balance between fetal demands and maternal supply. The more resources the fetus gets from the mother, the greater its chances of survival. However, if too many resources are expended on one pregnancy, this could come at the expense of the motherâ€™s health and chances of survival, sometimes leading to a non-concurrence in fetal demands and maternal allocation, which can give rise to conflict escalation and pregnancy complications. In this study, we analyze gene expression data of spontaneous preterm birth and elective termination. We identify significant differential gene expression, including upregulation of inflammation pathways and downregulation of growth pathways, suggesting that there a stress response and inadequate nutrient supply to the fetus during PTB. We also identify hub proteins that can constitute biomarkers for the development of PTB
