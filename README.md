# DGE-PTB
Preterm Birth (PTB), defined as birth before 37 weeks of gestation, leads to adverse outcomes in newborns and can cause death. Here, the transcriptomic landscape associated with PTB is explored through an evolutionary lens. In this project, gene expression data of spontaneous preterm birth and elective termination were analyzed. Significant differential gene expression was identifeid, including upregulation of inflammation pathways and downregulation of growth pathways, suggesting that there a stress response and inadequate nutrient supply to the fetus during PTB. The project supported the intrauterine environment response as a driver of PTB through the identification of these pathways. Further,  hub proteins were identified as potential biomarkers for the development of PTB
